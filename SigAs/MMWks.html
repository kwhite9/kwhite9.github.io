    <h1>Introduction to Molar Mass</h1>
<h2>Welcome! </h2>
Today we will be learning about <b>molar mass!</b> <br>
Molar mass is an important concept that chemists and chemistry students use every day. <br>
When looking at a reaction, you need to know how many molecules (roughly) of each reactant you need, so that you know how much of each material you need to add to your reaction. <br>
However, you can't count out each molecule! <br>
We need to relate how many molecules you have to an easier to measure quantity. The easiest way to do this is with mass! <br>
The way to relate mass and amount is through something called <b>molar mass</b>. <br><br> 

<h2>How Do I Find Molar Mass?</h2>
Molar mass is different for every compound, and must be calculated from your molecule's formula. <br>
To do this, find the mass of all of the atoms in one molecule of your compound, and add them all together. <br>
For example, ethane, C2H6, is composed of 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Carbon's molecular mass is 12 amu (atomic mass units), and hydrogen's molecular mass is 1 amu, <br>
so ethanes molar mass would be (2x12)+(6x1)= 30 amu/molecule! <br><br>

<h2>But Wait!</h2>
One last thing. The way we have this right now is actually the compounds <b><i>molecular</i></b> mass, not its <b><i>molar</b></i> mass. <br>
The scales in lab aren't nearly precise enough to measure atomic mass units (1 atomic mass unit = 1 proton or neutron), <br>
and if I'm weighing out grams of my compound, the amount of molecules is going to be ridiculously large. <br>
To solve this problem, the last thing we need to learn about is the concept of <b>moles.</b><br><br>

<h2>Moles</h2>
What is a mole?<br>
A <b>mole</b> is an amount, like a dozen. However, instead of 12, a mole is 6.022e23. <br>
Moles can confuse students at first, but it works the exact same way a dozen does. <br>
If I were to say "I have a dozen donuts", it means, "I have twelve donuts". <br>
If I were to say "I have a mole of donuts", it means, "I have 622,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 donuts." <br>
Moles are nice because they make the numbers much easier to manage ("1 mole" instead of "6.22e23 molecules") <br>
But the mole is also a very specific number that relate atomic mass units to grams. <br>
Because of this, the amount of atomic mass units per molecule of a substance is actually <b>equal</b> to the amount of grams per mole! <br><br>

So, back to our earlier example, ethane's <b>molecular</b> mass is 30 atomic mass units per molecule, and it's <b>molar</b> mass is 30 grams per mole! <br><br>

<h2>Check</h2>
If the sum of the masses of atoms in a molecule adds up to 50, that would be the molecule's:<br>
<input type="checkbox" value="molarmass" id="molarmass"> Molar Mass<br>
<input type="checkbox" value="molecularmass" id="molecularmass"> Molecular Mass<br>
<input type = "button" value="check" onclick="boxcheck();"> <br><br>

What is the molar mass of water if the atomic mass of oxygen (O) is 16 and the atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is 1? <br>
<input type="radio" name="water" value="17" id="seventeen">17
<input type="radio" name="water" value="18" id="eighteen">18
<input type="radio" name="water" value="19" id="nineteen">19 <br>
<input type = "button" value="check" onclick="radiocheck();">


<h2>Now It's Your Turn!</h2>
Now that we've done an example together, it's your turn to try a couple! <br>
Use the periodic table provided below to help you. The molecular/molar mass of each element is listed directly below it. <br><br>

<table>
<tr><td>What is the molar mass of salt (NaCl) to the nearest whole number?</td><td><input type="text" name="salt" id="salt"><input type=button value="check" onclick="saltmm();"></td></tr>
<tr><td>What is the molar mass of acetic acid (C2H4O2) to the nearest whole number?   </td><td><input type="text" name="vinegar" id="vinegar"><input type=button value="check" onclick="vinegarmm();"></td></tr>
<tr><td>What is the molar mass of quartz (SiO2) to the nearest whole number?</td><td><input type="text" name="quartz" id="quartz"><input type=button value="check" onclick="quartzmm();"></td></tr><br><br>

Molar mass can be tedious, right? Well, now that you know what it is and how to find it, I can show you the <a href=MMCalc.html>molar mass calculator.</a><br>
Additionally, if you would like something to help you build procedures for lab, check out the <a href="proc.html">procedure builder instead. </a><br>
