<H1> Abstract </H1>
<body>
<b> N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) </b> are an important class of molecules that are used as ligands in transition-metal catalysis. 
With two nitrogen bonding partners and a single lone pair of electrons, N-heterocyclic carbenes are reactive as Lewis bases/nucleophiles, and easily form coordination complexes with Lewis acidic transition metals. 
This body of research investigates both a multi-step strategy for synthesizing a chiral N-heterocyclic carbene precursor, as well as the use of the subsequent N-heterocyclic carbene as a ligand in a copper-catalyzed asymmetric reduction reaction.

<H2> Introduction </H2>
<body> 
Carbenes are a highly reactive organic intermediate consisting of a carbon with two bonding partners and a pair of electrons. 
Their lack of a full octet makes them a highly reactive species. N-heterocyclic carbenes are a specific class of carbene that include a carbene within a ring containing at least one (usually two) nitrogen atoms. 
This specific arrangement allows for increased stability, as the nitrogen atoms are able to donate electron density to the carbene center. 

The lone pair on an N-heterocyclic carbene allows it to act as a nucleophile, and it can form bonds to both metals and nonmetals. 
The ability of an N-heterocyclic carbene to act as a ligand for transition metals is a highly important area of study. 
N-Heterocyclic carbenes are comparable to phosphines within the realm of coordination chemistry, with several important differences. 
Synthetically, phosphines are often much harder to modify than NHCs. N-heterocyclic carbenes also tend to form stronger bonds than phosphines to a metal atom due their higher ability to donate electrons. 
Because of this, the complexes they form are often more stable.

Within the field of transition-metal catalysis, N-heterocyclic carbene are most well-known for their use in cross-coupling and metathesis reactions but have applications over a vast range of different reactions. 
One such reaction is asymmetric reduction, which we plan to explore when we synthesize our target ligand. 


<H3> Project Overview </H3>
<body>
Given that carbenes are a highly reactive and unstable group, initial synthesis focuses on the creation of their more shelf-stable precursor, an imidazolinium salt. 
This salt can be made into a carbene in situ through a single-step acid-base reaction.
The first steps of this synthesis involve the addition of both a primary aryl amine and an aminoalcohol group to ethyl chlorooxoacetate. 
The resulting oxalamide is then reduced to a diamine using lithium aluminum hydride. The final step in the formation of the imidazolinium salt is the acid-catalyzed condensation of the diamine using anhydrous HCl and trimethylorthoformate. 
The resulting product is a shelf-stable chiral imidazolinium salt. 
The treatment with a base deprotonates this salt and forms the final carbene. 
The carbene product has a chiral center on one of its side groups due to the addition of a chiral aminoalcohol in the initial steps. 
This chirality is crucial for its future use in a copper-catalyzed asymmetric reduction reaction.  

<H4> Project Outlook </H4>
<body> 
Once the carbene has been made, we hope to study its use in a reaction as a catalyst with aryl azirines, which can be synthesized from styrene. 
We intend to catalyze an asymmetric reduction of these 2H-azirines to aziridine using our NHC as part of a CuH catalyst. 
The resulting chiral aziridine productâ€™s high ring-strain enables it to react electrophilically and undergo a regio- and stereoselective ring-opening reaction.
 Chiral azirines are also  important intermediates from which many different biologically-relevant molecules can be synthesized.
